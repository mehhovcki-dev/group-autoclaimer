# mehhovcki group autoclaimer v6,

new generation of mehhovcki group autoclaimer. easier and powerful than ever!

## so, why this?
* deep user customization
* better speeds of group autoclaiming
* auto update detection
* ~~built-in bot, that allows you to change settings however you want~~ (in     development)
* proxies support, allowing to claim from anywhere

and more cool features to come.

so, if this is still **isn't enough for you** to switch to mehhovcki v6, i don't know what will make you do this.
